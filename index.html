                        <p>Emmy Heywood is originally from Star Valley, Wyoming, and is currently studying economics at Utah State University. Her first year at Utah State, Emmy was involved with Athletics United, a local nonprofit providing tutoring nights and running camps to refugee students in K-8th grade, where she befriended a few elementary school students via her mad tutoring skills and winning personality. She simultaneously had the chance to help research the impact of immigration on U.S. education with the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State. These two opportunities sparked a deeper empathy for students who face larger barriers to education than Emmy did, and catalyzed a desire to be a part of projects geared to improve learning for all students.</p>
